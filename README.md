Once upon a time, in a cozy forest filled with whispering trees and glowing fireflies,
a little bunny named Lulu couldn't sleep. She tiptoed outside and found a gentle owl sitting on a branch.
“Why can’t I sleep?” asked Lulu. The owl hooted softly, “Sometimes, you just need a bedtime wish.”
So Lulu closed her eyes, made a tiny wish on a twinkling star, and felt a warm breeze wrap around her like a hug.
The wind whispered lullabies as the trees swayed gently, and the fireflies danced above her like sparkling dreams.
Lulu yawned, curled up in the soft moss, and drifted into a peaceful sleep.
Good night, little one.
