############First Prompt (Using Gemini)

You are a story teller and you have to visually tell a lullaby song by using a webApp to a autisctic child.
Build: A web page for users in which they can put in a lullaby song and when they click on Tell the story, it's visuals should be shown in the Visuals Box of the UI, refer to the UI diagram attached.
FEATURES:
Do an integration of Imagen to generate pixel art for all the required objects from the Lullaby and make sure that the images are complementry in comic style
Do an integration of google gemini to understand the metaphors and interpretations of the Lullaby.
After the user inputs the song in the text box, and clicks on "Tell the story" button, the web app should go through the song to find all the nouns and generate pixel art for all of them and store it in the browser cache to access it.
Go thorough each and every line of the lullaby to understand the metaphors and generate the visuals to have at least one animated view for each line.
All the images should be generated by Imagegen Integration and the animations should be done using CSS and Javascript, you are free to use any library for the animations

PHASE 1:
Create the userinterface First and then implement all the features
Example of processing the Lullaby and animating it:
Suppose a user inputs these lines
"Rock-a-bye baby On the tree tops
When the wind blows The cradle will rock.
When the bough breaks The cradle will fall,
And down will come baby Cradle and all."
use gemini to understand the context and metaphors like
"Rock-a-bye Baby" is a well-known lullaby, and the phrase itself refers to the gentle rocking motion used to soothe a baby to sleep
for the first line, you should generate pixel arts for a baby in a cradle and a tree and you should do the animations of rocking which metaphorically means swinging on a tree branch.
for the second line, you should generate pixel art of wind blowing and using animations show it passing by the cradel and swinging it more.
for the third line, you should generate a pixel art of a bough breaking and showing an animation of it falling from the tree
